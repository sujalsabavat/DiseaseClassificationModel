# Disease Classification Model
Welcome to the Disease Classification Model repository! <br>
This project focuses on the development of a robust disease classification model using deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The model achieves a prediction rate of 98%, showcasing its effectiveness in accurately classifying diseases from agricultural set images.

## Problem Statement
Agriculture is confronted with challenges with onslaught attack on Tomato Plants. The key adversaries in this battle are the mosaic virus and yellow leaf curly virus. Early detection of these viruses is pivotal in mitigating their impact and safeguarding tomato crops. Timely identification allows for swift intervention, reducing the risk of widespread contamination and ensuring the health and yield of tomato plants. Unchecked viral infections can lead to significant economic losses for farmers, affecting both crop yield and quality. The challenge lies in detecting these viruses at their early stages when symptoms may not be visibly pronounced. Early detection is key to implementing timely interventions.
